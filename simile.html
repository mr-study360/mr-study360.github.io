            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Simile is a figure in which a likeness between two different things is stated in an explicit way.</p>
          
            <h2>Features of Simile</h2>
          <ul>
                <li>One things is likened to another</li>
                <li>The things are different in nature</li>
                <li>The likeness between them is clearly expressed with a word of comparison, such as like, as, such, and so etc.</li>
            </ul>

             <h2>Types of Simile</h2>
          <ol>
                <li>Regular simile</li>
                <li>Common simile</li>
                <li>Epic simile</li>
                <li>Sustained simile</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Regular simile</h2>
            <p>There is only one set of comparisons. Example: "She bid me take <u>love</u> easy, <u>as</u> the <u>leaves grow on the tree</u>." - (W.B. Yeats)</p>
            <p>Explanation: In this quote, <b>love</b> is being compared to <b>leaves grow on the tree</b>, referring that love should grow slowly, naturally, and without force. The word <b>as</b>, which is the indicator of simile, is used to show the comparison between two things (love and leaves grow on the tree). Since there is only one set of comparison, it is called a regular simile.</p>
            
            <h2>Examples of Similes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"Her smile was as bright as the sun."</li>
                <li>"He was as fast as a cheetah."</li>
                <li>"The night was as dark as coal."</li>
            </ul>
